- Designed an intelligent polymer AI Agent integrating LLMs for natural language query parsing with the TransPolymer, a pretrained transformer model for SMILES sequence sanity checking, and iterative modification by leveraging FastMCP server and finetuned Molecule Chef (2019) for suggesting candidate polymers. 

- Enabled automated prediction of polymer properties (bandgap, conductivity, dielectric constant, etc.) directly from polymer SMILES vector representations, and further modification of the polymer structure according to the user query.
