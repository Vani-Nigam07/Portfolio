- Orchestrated a conversational AI (CAI) model by developing a LangChain-based RAG architecture to efficiently prompt the GPT API to shift role according to the psychologically nuanced responses of the user.

- Worked with the Machine Learning team to deploy the CAI service to integrate the chat API to ensure scalable, real time performance and seamless data flow in a physical robotic system for users to converse with the AI agent during nighttime.
