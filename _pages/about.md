I am Vani Nigam, delving into AI/ML for scientific data, foundation models, Representation learning, NLP and Applied ML systems, combining theory with practical implementation!
I am pursuing my Masters of Science in Artificial Intelligence with a materials science specialisation at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA (USA) and I finished my Bachelors of technology in Materials Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, Odisha (India) in 2025.

I am looking forward to connecting to people with various applications in Generative AI, Materials Discovery and Automation of Microscopy (and a bit of book-fair hopping)!
