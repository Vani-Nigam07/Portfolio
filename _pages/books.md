Just descriptions, no spoilers.


### The Stationary Shop of Tehran
> Between the beautiful lines of Rumi, the two actors of this novel are in the most common love story. However, the families, the political disposition and the fate plans their separation. Years later, they are married to different people and have escaped their country's volatility. They do meet once, however the story ends in the MOST Khaled Hosseini's plot ever.

### A man called Ove
> I was scared to read it in the low times during the december winters. But my sister's assurance of a peaceful, fulfilling ending made me go ahead. The book has heart wrenching (Mr. Beans kinda sadness) situations faced by old Ove everyday. The book ends peacefully happy but gives my weak heart a lurch! 

### A murder is announced ~ Miss Marple Series
> An old English village suffers from an intimation of series of murders at the Little Paddocks, dwelling of a Ms. Blacklock.
